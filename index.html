          <p>Hi there, thanks for stopping by! My name is Kurt Statham, and I'm a budding young web developer. I spent over 12
            years in the casual games industry doing technical production on sites like <a href="http://www.addictinggames.com/"
              target="_blank">Addicting Games</a> and <a href="http://www.shockwave.com/" target="_blank">Shockwave</a>. Now that
            I've moved on from that I'm hoping to pivot to more of an engineering role.</p>
          <p>Originally from Oklahoma, I got my B.A. in French from UC Berkeley in 2003. I also hold a certificate in Java
            Programming from City College of San Francisco. Prior to working in casual games I had careers as both a bartender
            and a musician. I currently reside in Los Angeles, California, and when I'm not coding websites you can find me at
            the dance studio around the corner from my apartment where I study (and occasionally teach) various styles of
            ballroom dance.</p>
          <p>More about me? I'm six feet tall, with brown hair, brown eyes and a fairly slender build. In addition to enjoying
            cooking and hiking, my newest interests are woodworking and welding &mdash; skills I'm hoping to use to construct a
            headboard for my bed. I love animals and I've been know to brew my own beer from time to time. Want to know more? Why
            not take a moment to shoot me a message on my <a href="contact.html">contact form</a>!</p>
